# GridLibrary
A library for UE4 providing light weight grids

The Light Weight Grid Library Establishes the basis for a set of light weight grids for use in Unreal Engine 4.
For the initial release, the code has been packaged into two formats, a plugin or additional game module. In both
you will find a interface defined for interacting with grid and an implementation of that interface for a Geodesic
Grid of a Sphere. The plugin includes two examples of blueprints using the geodesic sphere: one to place static meshes at
grid locations and one to create a procedural static mesh.
